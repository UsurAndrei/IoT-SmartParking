# IoT-SmartParking
Project developed for our IoT class

By the Students:

* Andrei Rusu
* Pavlos Repin

The basis of Smart Exterior Parking project is the fact than anyone can easily 
find a parking space, something that in big cities such as Athens is
becoming increasingly difficult. In the project we created an artificial 
parking space - a city block, in which we have nodes at each
available and legal parking space, each node being a Arduino with a Sensor
able to monitor and send data about every legal parking space. The data can
be easily accessed by anyone through a Web Application or a Mobile Application,
so life can be easier for everyone in packed city where parking your vehicle
can be difficult.
