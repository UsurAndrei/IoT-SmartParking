The basis of Smart Exterior Parking is the fact than anyone can easily 
find a parking space, something that in big cities such as Athens is
becoming increasingly difficult. In the project we created a artificial 
parking space - a city block , in which we have nodes connected to each
available and legal parking space, which node being a Arduino Sensor
connected to a Rashberry. However since its very difficult to simulate it
in real life environment we will use Docker Swarm to simulate the sensors. 
Each node will be connected to a Data Base and using the Vue Js framework
a WebSite is showing the artificial Block and the available Parking Spaces.
Therefore, whenever a parking space is available the DB will be updated 
as will so the WebSite. To make the whole process available to any kind
of devices, by using the Bootstrap Vue framework anyone can easily keep
up to date with the available parking space.
